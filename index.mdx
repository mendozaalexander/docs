<Info>
  There are many ways yo change a tire, here is what allstate reccomends
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Park in a safe location" icon="circle-parking">
    If you have a flat, stop somewhere safe. The best area is away from traffic, on a flat, firm surface — not somewhere that has grass or soft dirt — and not in a blind spot or curve, advises [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/tire-buying-maintenance/how-to-change-a-car-tire-a2760414554/). Be sure to engage the parking or emergency brake and turn on your hazard lights, even during the day, to help other drivers see you.

  <Step title="Gather tools and supplies" icon="toolbox">
    You’ll typically need the following tools to change a flat tire:

    <Accordion title="Tools" icon="sparkles">
      - Car jack
      - Lug wrench
      - Spare tire
      - Your car’s owner’s manual
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Loosen the lug nuts" icon="screwdriver">
    Lug nuts are screwed onto the bolts and hold the wheels in place. Use your lug wrench and loosen — but do not remove — the lug nuts, [Pep Boys](https://www.pepboys.com/car-care/tire-care/changing-flat-tire) advises. Do this while the car is still on the ground, as the lug nuts may be on so tight that you have to use your body weight to loosen them. Keep in mind that if you have wheel locks on the tires, you may need to use a special adapter to remove them.

    If you don’t see your lug nuts, they may be behind a hub cap. You’ll need to unscrew or pry it off with a flathead screwdriver or the end of your lug wrench to pop it off, says [Popular Mechanics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/a5855/how-to-change-a-flat-tire/). Again, you should reference your car’s owner’s manual to see how to remove your car’s hubcaps so you don’t hurt yourself or damage the rim.
